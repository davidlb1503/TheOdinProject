            One major key to successfully cooking rice that is fluffy is rinsing the rice. 
            Rinsing the rice before cooking washes off excess starch from the grains. 
            Trust me when I say that getting rid of the excess starch makes a world of difference when cooking rice, so do not skip it. 
            Rinse the rice well until the water runs almost clear for the fluffiest rice possible.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Coconut milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by rinsing the rice. 
                Donâ€™t skip this step if you want fluffy, not gluey, coconut jasmine rice! 
                Place the plain rice in a fine mesh sieve and rinse under cold water until the water runs mostly clear. 
                Drain well and set aside for the moment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shake the can of coconut milk well. 
                In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring the coconut milk, 1/2 cup water, granulated sugar, and salt to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the rinsed rice to the pot and return the mixture to a boil. 
                Once it begins to boil, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. 
                Simmer until the liquid has been completely absorbed, about 15 minutes. 
                Resist the temptation to open up the pot or stir the rice during this time.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the coconut milk rice from the heat. 
                Leave it covered and let it steam for 10 minutes before fluffing the rice grains with a fork. 
                You can serve the rice as is or add toppings like toasted coconut flakes, chopped scallions, 
                or chopped cilantro.
